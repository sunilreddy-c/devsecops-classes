for creating a key in local we have a command called =====ssh -keygen -f "file-name"
once we proivde a command in gitbash it will generate a key in selected folder with ===public.key file and private.key file
that public-key i need to import to aws before that we need to signin into the account
once we login into aws under ===Network&security group we need to import the public key into key-pairs section
and we need to create a security group as well, Once we create a firewall in under secuirty group sections 
we need to add a public key in key-pairs section we need to select import key-pair section and give sample name and paste the content which have inside the public-key click on create 
now we need to launch the instance 
step.1 give sample name

step4.key.pair login===i have selected a which already created daws-84s

if we want to connect the instance from gitbash we have command called 
ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@publikey(3.235.68.206)
then it will automatically connected to the instance
