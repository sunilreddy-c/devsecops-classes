Crontab
========
/usr/bin:/bin

recently I was given a script to create backup of the files, I successfully created the script and shceduled in crontab, but command not found in crontab. When I executed it is working fine manually. Later I understood PATH is bare minimum in crontab so I changed my script as command into /usr/bin directory. It started working fine..

Configuration Management
========================
Provision server

system packages install
programming runtime install
application folders, users,etc
download the code
install dependencies
create service files
start the server

deployment
=======================
stop the service
1. remove the old version
2. download the new version, install dependencies
3. start the server

disadvantages
================
not idempotent
poor error handling
if we have more servers, very difficult to run --> not scalable
scripts works only for specific distro --> homogenous
syntax is little tough
password security is poor

Configuration Management Tools --> ansible, chef, rundeck, puppet, etc...
