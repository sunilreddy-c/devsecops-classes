permissios
==========
we have actually three sections in permissions 
read---4
write--2
execute--1
-       rw-              r--         r--
file/    user/owner       group       others
directory

ec2-user ec2-user 
group    user
we can called a user as u 
we can called a group as g
we can called a others as o

if we want to know in what are the permissions we have 
ls -l <filename>
if we want to give a write permission for specific file 

/etc/ssh/sshd_config


command is (chmod ugo+w <filename>

by using of numbers also we can change the permissions
only owmer of the file and /root user can change the permissions of file 

ownership
==========

now we can change the  ownership of the file 
chown <user>:<group> <filename>---it will change the group 
chowm <ownername> <filename>---it will change the owner
