process management
==================
ls -l --> it creates a process and assign a process ID, executes the command in kernel --> get the o/p --> display on screen
PID == processing Instance ID
PPID== parent proessing Iinstance ID
PS=== comand is used to check the how many processors are in running in currently existing user
ps -ef== this comand is used to check the how many processors are in running totally 

ps -ef | grep <process name> === this command is used to check which service is running or not

we have two types of processes 
1.foreground process
2.background process

if we give command (sleep 10) the server it will go for 10 seconds sleep
on that time commands will not execute
 sleep 10 == it will run in the foreground process
sleep 10 & ==it will run in the background process

Kill <PID> == it will kill the processor, in some scenarios it will not stop the processor
kill -9 <PID> == it will kill the processor forcefully
top -p PID --> check the resources used by particular process
htop --> human readable command

Network management
=====================
netstat -lntp--->

systemctl status <service-name>
ps -ef | grep service-name
netstat -lntp
top -p PID
