public ipaddress vs private ipaddress
=====================================
1.private-->192.168.0.5---its my system ipaddress to check this one we need to give command in command prompt like (ipconfig)
2.public-->49.205.240.186---> it will get from online
3.internal communication should be done using private IP
4.if we want to connect outside of network we need to use pblic IP

setuping a 3-tier architecture
=================================
front-end===back-end===database
first we are going to setup frintend
Linux - is aphysical server and nginx is a virtual server

while we install ngnix the command is (dnf install ngnix -y)
previously we are using a (yum install ngnix -y)
the updated vesrion of yum is dnf
in dnf we have option like we can able to see the modules means what are the latest vesrions are avaliable

installing ngnix in server
============================
1.(dnf module list nginx ) to check what are the latest versions are avaliable
2.before installing nginx we need to disable first (dnf module disable nginx -y)
3.again we emable this nginx(dnf module enable nginx:1.24 -y)
4.then we are going to instll(dnf install nginx -y)
5.once its installed we need to start the nginx
6.systemctl start nginx
7.once its installed we need to check its running or not
8.systemctl status nginx
9.for checking process for nginx (ps-ef | grep nginx)
10.checking port of nginx (netstat -lntp)
11.if we want to check nginx properly installed or not in server we can take ipaddress and check in browser it will show content then it will installed
