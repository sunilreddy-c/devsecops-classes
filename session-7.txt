we have our own Amazon meachine image(devops-practice)
usdername=ec2user password=DevOps321
this is not keybased one --this is password based one 

actuall what is image
where picture captured with some sourndings

AMI == AMI is base OS
it will created on top of redhat 9
it will contaian pre-confihured ones like memeory+operations+packages+applications+nginx like we have ---> it will create an AMI and take it as an image
pre-configured OS with some packages

Launching AMI
===============
1.click on launch instance
2.in the ddown section we have browse AMIs section we need to click on that
3.then we need to select community AMIs
4.search devops-practice
5.then we can able to see (rheldevops-practice)
6.then we need to select t3.micro
7.then in the password section we need to selct (proceed without key-pair)
8.it is not key-pair one , it is the one we use username and password
9.i the security group we need to selct already existing one (allow-all)
10.click on launch instance

public ipaddress vs private ipaddress
=====================================
1.private-->192.168.0.5---its my system ipaddress to check this one we need to give command in command prompt like (ipconfig)
2.public-->49.205.240.186---> it will get from online
3.internal communication should be done using private IP
4.if we want to connect outside of network we need to use pblic IP

setuping a 3-tier architecture
=================================
front-end===back-end===database
first we are going to setup frintend
Linux - is aphysical server and nginx is a virtual server

while we install ngnix the command is (dnf install ngnix -y)
previously we are using a (yum install ngnix -y)
the updated vesrion of yum is dnf
in dnf we have option like we can able to see the modules means what are the latest vesrions are avaliable

installing ngnix in server
============================
1.(dnf module list nginx ) to check what are the latest versions are avaliable
2.before installing nginx we need to disable first (dnf module disable nginx -y)
3.again we emable this nginx(dnf module enable nginx:1.24 -y)
4.then we are going to instll(dnf install nginx -y)
5.once its installed we need to start the nginx
6.systemctl start nginx
7.once its installed we need to check its running or not
8.systemctl status nginx
9.for checking process for nginx (ps-ef | grep nginx)
10.checking port of nginx (netstat -lntp)
11.if we want to check nginx properly installed or not in server we can take ipaddress and check in browser it will show content then it will installed

I want to do some changes config changes in nginx
===================================================
1.for that we need to check in cd/etc/nginx----all the config files are present in this folder
2.inside this we have nginx.conf we have actually 
3.if we want to open the that nginx.conf folfder
4. command is ======vin nginx.conf
4.it will display the content
5.all the port details and login details are avaliable here 
6.interview question === how you can change the port number in nginx
7.cd/etc/nginx===> inside that we have nginx.conf folder there we have option to change the port number
8.once the port number is changes we can restart the server
9. if we want to change the content in for displaying while we login to nginx server 
10.command is (/usr/share/nginx/html) 
11.before that we can take a server IP of that we can check in browser that will display a exitising content
12.we have chance to replace it by edting this file (/usr/share/nginx/html) inside this we have index.html what ever the content have in index.html it will show that content
13.i want to delete the default content which present in (/usr/share/nginx/html) folder
14.rm-rf *===it will delete the whole content which present in the inside the files  (/usr/share/nginx/html)
15.i should install our application inside that folder 

==by using of this url (curl -o /tmp/frontend.zip https://roboshop-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/frontend-v3.zip)--we can store that content in tmp directory
==we can check in /tmp directory frontend.zip file will be created in tmp directory
==we need to extract the content which is present in inside 
==(cd /usr/share/nginx/html) in this folder we are going to unzip the folder
==once the unzip the folder, we need to change the content in nginx.conf folder
==(vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf)== check into folder
==if we want to delete the whole content in folder we can use command called (%d)==it will delete the content
==once the changes is done we need to restart the application
==once we restart the content will be changed

== we are trying to login the nginx page by using port number right 
==we dont want to give consumer the port number 
==we need to give DNS means with name like (devops.com or giving.com) like that
==for DNS  purchasing 
==(godaddy) is costly === 
==cheapestone (hostiner) is cheap
