How DNS works
google.com --> browser cache --> OS --> OS Cache --> ISP DNS resolver --> root servers --> TLD info --> .com TLD --> name servers --> A record
name servers --> who are managing that domain now
domain registar --> a mediator to sell the domain, they have default name servers

create hosted zone in AWS, get the NS records and update in domain provider
TTL --> time to live is DNS cache before issuing next DNS request

below one all are certificates
A --> IpV4
CNAME --> points to another domain
MX --> mail records
TXT --> domain verification
NS --> Nameservers
AAAA -> Ipv6
